# 🚀 Engineering Journey – From Theory to Production

Welcome 👋

This repository documents my evolution as a software engineer — 
from learning core concepts to applying them in real production systems.

It is not just notes.

It is a record of:
- 📚 Concepts I study
- 🛠 Real-world implementations
- 🧠 Engineering decisions
- ❌ Mistakes and lessons
- 📈 Performance improvements
- 🏗 Architecture evolution

The goal is simple:
Turn knowledge into production-ready engineering skills.

## 🧠 Engineering Principles I Follow

- Write code for humans first, machines second.
- Measure before optimizing.
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness.
- Design for scalability early.
- Always document decisions.

---

## 📊 Growth Metrics

- Reduced API latency from 800ms → 150ms
- Reduced DB load by 40% using caching
- Containerized 3 production services
- Improved error handling coverage by 30%
